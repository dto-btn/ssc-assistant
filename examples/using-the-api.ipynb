Each year, deputy ministers from various departments, agencies and Crown corporations put their knowledge to the test to raise funds for the GCWCC and compete for the title of Trivia Master. To make it to the final round, teams had to earn the most points to secure one of the 5 final spots, or raise the most money to earn one of the 2 wild spots. In the first round, Ctrl Alt Reboot put up a strong fight, hoping to earn enough points to move onto the final round on December 5. Unfortunately, the team did not earn enough points to move forward after being stumped by some difficult Canadian history questions. A total of $830 was raised for the GCWCC. To celebrate the team's efforts and participation in the campaign, the President hosted a pizza lunch for the team on Thank You Thursday (November 30). Thank you to all who participated and donated! In order from left to right: Lisa Sullivan, Johanne Paquette, Jonathan Pankratz, Scott Jones, Christopher Thomas, Su Webster As the campaign comes to a close, please keep in mind that SSC's commitment to giving lasts all year.

I would like to thank Sony Perron for his leadership at SSC over the past 3 years and, in particular, during his time as President. He has been a great ally and friend. Our colleagues at the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec are very lucky to have Sony join as their President. With a new President comes change, and we will have time to speak more about that in the near future. However, I think it\\u2019s important to say up front what will continue. First, our commitment to each other\\u2014to working together to make SSC an even better place to work. This includes our critical progress on equity, diversity and inclusion, a key part of our goal to make SSC an employer of choice. You will see this commitment reflected in our HR strategy, which is in its final stage of development. That strategy is all about us, the people of SSC. Second, we will continue to improve our change, incident and operations management. This work has been ongoing since the creation of SSC and is core to our mandate. To me, this means our entire approach to technology acquisition, management, service and lifecycle. Third, our focus on our roadmaps\\u2014those already published and those still to come\\u2014are the basis of our strategic plan and our commitment to our partners. We will continue to advance this under the Digital Together strategy. It takes a broad team to deliver on SSC\\u2019s mission. We sometimes slip into talking technology, but nothing I\\u2019ve mentioned above comes without the entire SSC team of professionals. SSC has always been important, but I believe we are only going to become more critical and central to everything the government wants to deliver. I\\u2019m excited to take on the role of President at this critical time in our future. I look forward to continuing my work with all of you in this incredible organization. Thank you for your ongoing support.\",\n",
