Meetings with Employee Networks 18 Raising lived experiences and issues at all levels of SSC One important role of the Ombuds is to provide timely, actionable feedback to senior levels of the organization. We can tell employees’ stories and point to developing trends, sometimes before they can be noticed and measured by formal feedback mechanisms such as employee surveys. This upward feedback can take many shapes including informal chats, management briefings and documents such as this report. As Ombuds, I participate in various senior fora including: weekly Executive Oversight Board meetings where I occasionally provide issue-specific observations. the President and Executive Vice President every six weeks for one-on-one discussions. the DG of Human Resource and Workplace regularly. This is critical as the vast majority of the cases we deal with involve an element of HR in whole or in part. I also meet with senior managers periodically to exchange ideas and advise them on areas of mutual concern. It is important that we understand what the bargaining agents hear from their members. To that end, we have regular meetings with the unions as a group and also individually. Their insights are useful in shaping our understanding of SSC and I appreciate their candour. In the past year, seven such meetings were held in addition to several separate discussions. Meetings with Senior Managers 19 Meetings with Unions 7 \"One important role of the Ombuds is to provide timely, actionable feedback to senior levels of the organization.\" Other groups The Office of the Ombuds staff participates in every employee group possible where appropriate. This includes networks such as Agora, Managers’ and Administrative Professionals, the Official Language working group and many others. We are also involved with the Government of Canada’s Organizational Ombuds Council, the Forum of Canadian Ombudsman and the International Association of Ombuds to maintain links to best practices and development of the ombuds’ business. Our Observations People have shared issues of many different natures over the past year. This report focusses on four key areas that were raised on numerous occasions: mental health, the experience of members of equity-seeking groups, the treatment of women, and the relationship between managers and their staff. Observation 1: We are meeting high demand at the cost of the mental health of people. Context: Mental health and illness affects everyone in the workplace, whether it’s you or someone on your team that is not at their best. Many continue to suffer in silence despite efforts to normalize and destigmatize the discussion of mental health, and mental health issues are increasing to levels of serious concern. One clear indicator is provided by Long Term Disability (LTD) statistics from the insurance company that covers public servants. They report that approximately two-thirds of LTD claims are now related to mental health. This number does not include all the short-term medical leave taken by employees, from a mental health day to prescribed stress and other mental health related leave. Additionally, the Association of Professional Executives of the Public Service of Canada (APEX) conducted a survey where 74% of SSC’s Executives reported “severe” burnout or exhaustion as compared to 75% governmentwide. A further 26% of the SSC respondents said they had felt a lesser level of burnout or exhaustion. This means all SSC Executives have suffered to a degree. Source: APEX Executive Work and Health Study 2021/22 What we heard: The current pace of work is unsustainable People work at SSC because they believe in what the organization stands for and they enjoy the type of work they do. Many employees at all levels report feeling like they have been asked to do too much since the start of the pandemic. It is being likened to running a marathon at the pace of a sprint. There is also a belief that this pace has become the norm and is now expected on an ongoing basis. This is particularly true of those in the service lines. They sincerely believe that the department is willing to sacrifice their wellbeing to avoid upsetting client organizations and project leaders.', 'filepath': None, 'id': None, 'title': 'Annual Report 2021-22, Office of the Ombuds', 'url': 'https://plus.ssc-spc.gc.ca/en/page/annual-report-2021-22-office-ombuds'}, {'chunk_id': None, 'content': 'Message from the President &amp; Executive Vice-President on the Occasion of SSC’s 10th Anniversary Today marks 10 years since the beginning of Shared Services Canada (SSC)! We want to celebrate all we have done and how far we have come. It is worth looking back at how SSC was created when Lisanne Forand, SSC’s first President, was tasked with standing up the department. On August 4, 2011, after much strategic consideration about a new model to serve the Government of Canada’s information technology needs, the creation of a new department, Shared Services Canada was announced in the House of Commons. About 1,500 Information Technology infrastructure services and related funding and personnel were transferred from Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to SSC by Order-in-Council. And, Shared Services Canada was officially born. In the months that followed, positions were transferred from more than 40 departments and agencies to form the department that we know today. The creation of SSC would eventually bring the IT infrastructure and procurement of all government departments under one umbrella. It was an important yet complex transformation. Our second president, Ron Parker, began his leadership of SSC in July 2015. Under Ron, hiring ramped up, and SSC focussed more on service delivery. Since 2019, we have put the “shared” into Shared Services. Our enterprise approach has accelerated digital government in a global pandemic. In just 10 years, SSC has evolved from a rough patchwork of IT services to a world-class enterprise service provider. We went from building a department from scratch to delivering end‑to‑end digital services to public servants and Canadians in a global pandemic. To all the people who were there from the beginning, and along the way, you have accomplished the near impossible. SSC has risen to the challenge – it’s been 10 years of real progress! We are incredibly proud of how far we’ve come and who we are now. This is a good time to take a look back at what we have accomplished over the last decade and celebrate our successes, our efforts, and talent. Because of the hard work and dedication of our employees past and present, we’ve evolved far beyond the initial vision for Shared Services Canada. It is also a good time to look ahead. We are now embarking on our second decade and helping our government realize its vision of a wholly digital government. We have all the building blocks in place to get to where we want to be. In 10 years, we’ve built a first-rate technology organization where we live, breathe and work in a 24/7 digital landscape. Mark your calendars and join us on November 15th for our 10 year Anniversary Celebration. Help us mark the successes of our last decade and kickstart an exciting future together.

It presents high-level statistics and an overview of the main issues raised by visitors who used our services. It also serves as an organizational health indicator for SSC. This past fiscal year presented personal and professional challenges for SSC’s workforce due to the ongoing pandemic, a high demand, the uncertainty of our evolving workplace and world events. Such challenges converged and affected every one of us in ways we could not have foreseen. We have clearly seen the impact all this has had on mental health, and it is worrying. People are showing signs of heightened mental fragility that clearly affects them and their work. This is not unique to SSC and much research into mental health in the past couple years supports this view. While we observe significant institutional efforts to support employees’ mental health, the underlying factors that cause the work related stress remain often unaddressed. During the year, we handled 243 cases. While this number is consistent with past years, we note that cases seem to be more complex and require more time to resolve. This is reflected in the number of people involved in each case. In total, our office provided services to 886 people. In this report, you will find four observations I have made based on everything we have heard. I have also included four recommendations that could concretely improve the lives of SSC’s employees at work. I am encouraged by the focus and investment SSC has put on key issues such as diversity and inclusion, official languages at work, and harassment prevention. These efforts must be sustained for SSC to become the organization it can be, where all of its members feel they belong and can contribute their best. An organization that not only leads the public service in technology, but also as an employer of choice. My team and I will continue to offer a service where everyone at SSC can share their experience, gain perspective on the challenging situations they face, get advice on productive ways to approach issues, and have someone raise their issues to the right people.

We’re in year three of a pandemic, our personal lives have been greatly impacted, change has most definitely been the constant, SSC has demonstrated its value to the Public Service, and we now need to define the future of work. Add to this the moral obligation to evolve the systems to allow everyone to feel like they belong at work, while ensuring we are preserving our mental health as we are being tested by these challenging times. Here we are. We’ve learned to live with the uncertainty, not that it has become easier to do so. There is still an ongoing sense of urgency and pressure to deliver a significant amount of work due to the high demand for what SSC delivers. Many are tired. The focus on results delivery over the care for others has lead to moments where some are being short with others, maybe less polite, sometimes less kind. This comes with important personal and business costs. The mental health of our employees at every level of the organization is my number one concern. SSC was under the gun from the very start of the pandemic. Our people responded with dedication and professionalism and hit the ground running. As an organization we launched into a sprint to make it all happen. Except the sprint turned into a marathon and we haven’t adjusted our pace. It’s not sustainable, it is reflected in the type of behaviours we hear about. The future remains unclear and people want to know what to expect. That information is not readily forthcoming because everyone is trying to sort it out. If change is your constant, then the role of management is to even out the waves and troughs and minimize uncertainty.', 'filepath': None, 'id': None, 'title': 'Annual Report 2021-22, Office of the Ombuds', 'url': 'https://plus.ssc-spc.gc.ca/en/page/annual-report-2021-22-office-ombuds'}, {'chunk_id': None, 'content': 'This work supports SSC’s efforts to break down silos and effectively remove impediments to the enterprise approach Ensure employee participation through meaningful and direct exchanges with SSC employees and through thoughtful preparation and curation of the engagement events.

Activities include establishing an editorial board, collaborating with other departments, and hosting an Innovation Day. Outcomes aim to enhance SSC’s internal and external communications impact and reputation. Support for Networks and Champions A new approach will be implemented to support Diversity Networks, Professional Networks and the Agora Network, as well as Champion-led corporate initiatives. This includes assigning a dedicated manager, creating an inclusive communications charter, and optimizing use of Professional Networks. The goal is to achieve more effective communication and collaborative priority setting within SSC. Studio and Open Broadcast Environment (OBE) model The Communications team will integrate new technologies to host hybrid events more efficiently, reducing dependency on external contractors. This includes collaborating with the CIO to utilize new software and equipment, aiming to save costs, increase flexibility, and provide better support for SSC leadership and events. Serving Government website improvement The Serving Government website will be enhanced to improve self-service features, content and navigation, aligning with corporate branding. The focus will be on developing governance for report generation, finalizing security assessments, and launching an authenticated section for user testing. This will reduce the workload on Client Executives and service line employees and foster better client relationships. Strategic consideration The following table explores the current social, demographic, technical and political environment that could potentially influence positively or negatively the overall delivery of this communications approach and its activities. Opportunities have been identified to mitigate some of these issues should they arise. Risk/Issue/Environment Scope of SSC Mandate, SSC size/silos Subject-matter experts in SSC’s different branches often operate in silos and may not be aware of what the other branches are working on. This can result in missed communications opportunities. Opportunities Communications Advisors can act as a catalyst of information for their clients and help convey a cohesive story Increase briefings for leaders and managers to ensure pertinent information gets fanned out appropriately to teams, but also to collect information on Branch projects, activities and successes Provide audiences with clear, timely information on SSC’s work and how it benefits and impacts their operations Low awareness/Lack of trust in SSC services Clients may perceive SSC as being “slow and expensive.” Serving Government survey feedback revealed low engagement and awareness of the site and services, and negative criticism from those who do use it. SSC is often mistaken for Service Canada. Opportunities Leverage senior management engagement and communicate opportunities with stakeholders to tell a better story about how SSC is delivering on time and to explain the costs SSC is engaging with Serving Government stakeholders for input on its redesign. As SSC’s primary digital channel to connect with partners and clients, it is an opportunity to build trust by ensuring content meets their needs and services are easy to locate The recruitment campaign will use a consistent and cohesive suite of graphics and key messages to mitigate any confusion with Service Canada Alignment of Government of Canada digital priorities SSC is a key player in delivering on both Canada’s Digital Ambition and the Future of Work (TBS).

SSC has an opportunity to gain efficiency by improving burdensome business processes. This would in turn reduce the impact on the mental health of staff. It seems that many major decisions are made at the highest levels of SSC without the participation of those who will implement and live with the consequences. At the same time, there is a significant desire on the part of middle and senior management to be engaged and help the organization define processes and outcomes. There are few horizontal initiatives at the Director level to tap into this talent pool to address organizational issues. This could be an effective avenue to address what our office views as the greatest risk the organization will face in the coming years: the mental health of people at SSC. Many people raised issues about sources of inefficiencies and friction. Some feel that SSC addresses process issues by adding a process over a process, or a new policy on top of a problematic policy instead of addressing the inherent issue. In addition, the matrix approach to accountability for project management within SSC leads to confusion and sometimes a lack of knowing “who’s who in the zoo”. This is further complicated by the numerous and frequent reorganizations and re-rolling of teams. While several senior managers raised the situation on the operational side of SSC, we also saw many examples of overly complex and bureaucratic HR policies and practices, some of which are clearly within SSC’s purview. These should be subject to a serious overhaul to reduce and streamline legacy practices that go back to when SSC was “thrown together”. Recommendation 2 – Develop a policy tool to ensure conflict be resolved at the lowest level possible. SSC should have a policy that communicates the expectation that workplace issues are to be resolved at the lowest level possible with a minimum of delay. It is important to note that this recommendation reflects comments made on more than one occasion by SSC’s President as a preferred approach to resolving workplace issues. Resolving workplace issues at the lowest possible level is not only the ethical way to address it, it makes business sense. It ensures the generation of ideas and perspectives that lead to a more open and creative exchange. It also ensures we maximize talent retention and productive relationships by creating and building upon fundamental relationships based on interpersonal rather than transactional dealings. When people are treated as humans rather than business transactions, employees feel a greater sense of being treated as an individual and create a feeling of belonging. This maximizes retention and productive relationships. In order to create a culture that fosters such an approach, the foundations need to be in place. Recommendation 3 – Include control mechanisms in staffing processes to favour diversity. Hiring managers should prioritize increasing representation when staffing positions. SSC should have control measures to ensure managers demonstrate how they have considered diversity when staffing. They should provide a solid justification when their team is not representative when qualified candidates from equity-seeking groups are available yet not selected. Recommendation 4 – Require EX minus 1 and 2 to go through a leadership program before acting or being appointed to EX levels. Many instances of conflict arise because of a lack of experience or knowledge of key policies, behaviours and practices from the first instances of supervisory duties up to managers and even directors. While much will be acquired through osmosis and observation, up and coming managers should develop their skills in the areas of emotional intelligence, leadership and change management. Looking to the Future The Office is in its fifth year of operation and serving you remains our top priority. We are also developing a research and analysis capability that will allow us to provide greater insight on issues of concern and workplace trends. In 2022-23, the Office will: continue to provide high quality service to help you navigate workplace issues resume geographic visits to SSC employees across the country if possible conduct more detailed analysis of trends and provide upward feedback field a questionnaire for employees of equity-seeking groups to hear their personal experiences continue to monitor the issue of mental health at SSC Our goals are ambitious and our intention is to help make SSC an ever-better place to work.
