    "# Using the SSC Assistant API\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python notebook can be used on your local device using VS Code. It contains working code that you can execute locally after cloning or copying. It demonstrates how to use the SSC Assistant API using your given API token and a user Access token (oauth2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we use the OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow. We do not support user authentication flows for API calls at this time (although it might still be technically possible). In other words, you will have to authenticate as your app itself; a user will never have to be asked for permissions to log into the app, and there will be no redirect. In order to help us support you better, we strongly recommend not using user authentication flows for the API requests at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "First, copy the `.env.example` that is adjacent to this file into a new file, `.env`. Then, fill in the variables according to the following instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables can be broadly categorized as either SSC Assistant-related, or client application-related\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSC Assistant-Related Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API_ENDPOINT\n",
    "\n",
    "The `API_ENDPOINT` points at the SSC Assistant API server that you would like to query. You will be provided this value by our team upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:5001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API_SCOPE\n",
    "\n",
    "The `API_SCOPE` defines the permissions that your session will contain. The `applicationId` (also called the `clientId`) part is referring to the SSC Assistant's ID. You will be provided this value by our team upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_SCOPE=api://<applicationId>/.default\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client Application-Related Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### APP_ID\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a credential that is specific to your application. This value can be retrieved from Azure Portal, and is generally provided by an App Administrator who has the correct permissions on Azure Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### APP_SECRET\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a credential that is specific to your application. This value can be retrieved from Azure Portal, and is generally provided by an App Administrator who has the correct permissions on Azure Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TENANT_ID\n",

Each year, deputy ministers from various departments, agencies and Crown corporations put their knowledge to the test to raise funds for the GCWCC and compete for the title of Trivia Master. To make it to the final round, teams had to earn the most points to secure one of the 5 final spots, or raise the most money to earn one of the 2 wild spots. In the first round, Ctrl Alt Reboot put up a strong fight, hoping to earn enough points to move onto the final round on December 5. Unfortunately, the team did not earn enough points to move forward after being stumped by some difficult Canadian history questions. A total of $830 was raised for the GCWCC. To celebrate the team's efforts and participation in the campaign, the President hosted a pizza lunch for the team on Thank You Thursday (November 30). Thank you to all who participated and donated!

We want to celebrate all we have done and how far we have come. It is worth looking back at how SSC was created when Lisanne Forand, SSC\\u2019s first President, was tasked with standing up the department. On August 4, 2011, after much strategic consideration about a new model to serve the Government of Canada\\u2019s information technology needs, the creation of a new department, Shared Services Canada was announced in the House of Commons. About 1,500 Information Technology infrastructure services and related funding and personnel were transferred from Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to SSC by Order-in-Council. And, Shared Services Canada was officially born. In the months that followed, positions were transferred from more than 40 departments and agencies to form the department that we know today. The creation of SSC would eventually bring the IT infrastructure and procurement of all government departments under one umbrella. It was an important yet complex transformation. Our second president, Ron Parker, began his leadership of SSC in July 2015. Under Ron, hiring ramped up, and SSC focussed more on service delivery. Since 2019, we have put the \\u201cshared\\u201d into Shared Services. Our enterprise approach has accelerated digital government in a global pandemic. In just 10 years, SSC has evolved from a rough patchwork of IT services to a world-class enterprise service provider. We went from building a department from scratch to delivering end\\u2011to\\u2011end digital services to public servants and Canadians in a global pandemic. To all the people who were there from the beginning, and along the way, you have accomplished the near impossible. SSC has risen to the challenge \\u2013 it\\u2019s been 10 years of real progress! We are incredibly proud of how far we\\u2019ve come and who we are now. This is a good time to take a look back at what we have accomplished over the last decade and celebrate our successes, our efforts, and talent. Because of the hard work and dedication of our employees past and present, we\\u2019ve evolved far beyond the initial vision for Shared Services Canada. It is also a good time to look ahead. We are now embarking on our second decade and helping our government realize its vision of a wholly digital government. We have all the building blocks in place to get to where we want to be. In 10 years, we\\u2019ve built a first-rate technology organization where we live, breathe and work in a 24/7 digital landscape. Mark your calendars and join us on November 15th for our 10 year Anniversary Celebration. Help us mark the successes of our last decade and kickstart an exciting future together. Please visit the 10th anniversary celebration page on MySSC for event details and to view profiles of SSC founders and other commemorative content.\",\n",

Keep reading for his initial thoughts after his first month in the role. What was your first impression of SSC? Has it changed since your arrival? \\\"I\\u2019ve been working with SSC since it was created so I have been able to see the evolution of the department since its creation. Through the pandemic I saw SSC accelerate and execute its plans and prove why SSC is so critical to the evolution of the GC towards digital. I can\\u2019t imagine how the Government would have adapted to a pandemic without SSC. I am amazed at the number of one-offs SSC is asked to do for departments and I\\u2019m not sure the Government of Canada has embraced the concept of \\u2018enterprise\\u2019. We are a little bit in the shadows of government and that\\u2019s a good thing. We should be like electricity in our houses; just take for granted that it\\u2019s going to be there. SSC is the government department that delivers on everything I studied and spent my career doing. But teams need to be careful because I could spend hours just talking to the networking team on how they\\u2019re setting up the core switching between the enterprise data centres. The work here is really fascinating and key to the digital ambition of the government!\\\" How would you describe your leadership style, and what are the leadership skills you value the most? \\\"I\\u2019m a big fan of transparency. I like to surround myself with people who aren't like me and bring different skills, experiences and perspectives to the table so we can find the best solution. I don\\u2019t like micromanaging (or being micromanaged for that matter!). I think it\\u2019s important to be able to say, \\u201chere's where I think we need to get to\\u201d and then leave it to others\\u2019 creativity to decide how we get there. But, most of all, I hope people see me as someone who cares and wants to help them grow and succeed.\\\" How do you envision your role at SSC? \\\"The President and EVP are a team. I believe the role really is to say \\u201cWhere do we need to be in two or three or more years? What does that need to look like and how do we make sure we\\u2019re aligning to that?\\u201d My role is also to represent us to the rest of the government, be a bit of a cheerleader, and make people understand what we're facing. Along with Sony, my job is to manage the relationships outside of SSC and make sure we\\u2019re aligned inside to what\\u2019s needed to deliver on the government mandate. As a service provider, we will never be as fast as people would dream of but there are laws of time and space that get in the way. I also see my role as being a bit of a defender of SSC too and giving us the space to build enterprise services rather than what each department decides it wants.\\\" Tell us about your dual role as EVP at SSC and Associate DM at PSPC? \\\"This is the first time this has ever been done, so it\\u2019s in development. I see my job as the fulltime EVP here with specific file responsibilities at PSPC. I have a great colleague in Arianne at PSPC who is supporting the Deputy there, which gives me more scope to support Sony here. There are lots of opportunities where SSC and PSPC overlap, intersect and complementary. For example, returning to the workplace. There\\u2019s a real property dimension to it, but there\\u2019s also an IT and an enabling dimension to it. Given that we report to the same minister, it also gives me a unique perspective in seeing how each department is approaching the same question.\\\" To keep him on his toes, we wrapped up with a lightning round! Favourite type of music? \\\"I\\u2019m pretty all over the map. Whatever is playing.\\\" What do you like to read? \\\"I like fantasy and science fiction.\\u00a0If I\\u2019m reading to learn, I find biographies really interesting. The nerdy side of me reads some management type books, but innovation is one of the themes I find really fascinating. Often people confuse innovation with invention.\\\" How do you spend your free time? \\\"I like home improvement, woodworking, things that I can do with my hands and don\\u2019t involve a computer.\\\" Ottawa Red Blacks or Saskatchewan Roughriders?\",\n",
