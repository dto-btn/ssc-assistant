    "# Using the SSC Assistant API\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python notebook can be used on your local device using VS Code. It contains working code that you can execute locally after cloning or copying. It demonstrates how to use the SSC Assistant API using your given API token and a user Access token (oauth2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we use the OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow. We do not support user authentication flows for API calls at this time (although it might still be technically possible). In other words, you will have to authenticate as your app itself; a user will never have to be asked for permissions to log into the app, and there will be no redirect. In order to help us support you better, we strongly recommend not using user authentication flows for the API requests at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "First, copy the `.env.example` that is adjacent to this file into a new file, `.env`. Then, fill in the variables according to the following instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables can be broadly categorized as either SSC Assistant-related, or client application-related\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSC Assistant-Related Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API_ENDPOINT\n",
    "\n",
    "The `API_ENDPOINT` points at the SSC Assistant API server that you would like to query. You will be provided this value by our team upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:5001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API_SCOPE\n",
    "\n",
    "The `API_SCOPE` defines the permissions that your session will contain. The `applicationId` (also called the `clientId`) part is referring to the SSC Assistant's ID. You will be provided this value by our team upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_SCOPE=api://<applicationId>/.default\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client Application-Related Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### APP_ID\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a credential that is specific to your application. This value can be retrieved from Azure Portal, and is generally provided by an App Administrator who has the correct permissions on Azure Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### APP_SECRET\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a credential that is specific to your application. This value can be retrieved from Azure Portal, and is generally provided by an App Administrator who has the correct permissions on Azure Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TENANT_ID\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a credential that is specific to your application. This value can be retrieved from Azure Portal, and is generally provided by an App Administrator who has the correct permissions on Azure Portal."

Look around! You are now on our new and improved intranet site! The new site has features that give you a better user experience and easier search capabilities. You probably know by now that in January, SSC+ kicked off its beta launch with the new News, Blog, Events and Gigabit sections. The best part is that there\\u2019s even more to come! Let\\u2019s learn more about how SSC+ is taking shape and about how you can help to make the site the best it can be. Building from scratch My SSC is our main intranet site and although it serves its purpose, we definitely needed to improve it. This is why we are creating SSC+! Before launching the beta phase of SSC+, the Communications and CIO teams put in a lot of planning\\u00a0 to bring SSC+ to life. They studied the problems with My SSC and made a plan to share information more easily on SSC+. Read on as Lauren Wong shares what her team is building to improve this. \\u201cI think most of the work that went into the new site is our Information Architecture. I don\\u2019t believe we had an official document of all our content and a lot has been created without thinking about the big picture of the site. We have struggled with overlap or difficulties finding what we are looking for. Reviewing our current content, making the right changes, and planning the structural design for the environment we share information on has been a tremendous effort from the team.\\u201d Lauren Wong, Innovation Team, Communications Curating an experience that\\u2019s all about you Technology wouldn\\u2019t be as meaningful as it is today if it were only about the technical parts. What brings it all together is how it can transform and simplify our lives. Read what Daniel Brousseau, had to say about the role of SSC+ in doing just this. \\u201cSSC+ aims to make life easier for the user. If an employee wants to attend an event, they can actually just add it to their calendar directly from SSC+. That\\u2019s one of the things available now and later on, engagement features will be available. For example, you see a blog post, and you see some comments. If you want to follow that conversation, you can \\u201cwatch\\u201d that page and be notified when a comment is added. That\\u2019s one of the things we\\u2019re looking to apply on those types of content to generate that engagement to promote what\\u2019s happening inside the organization. Daniel Brousseau, team lead of the Innovation Team, Communications How you can help customize your experience We want to hear from you! Now is the perfect time to share your feedback. SSC+ is currently in phase\\u00a02, the testing, refinement and content migration stage. Help shape your web experience and what information you are looking for on subjects like Pay and Benefits. When you join the SSC+ beta community, Communications team members will reach out to you when they have information architecture testing and feature testing to do. Alternatively, you can leave your feedback in the comment box at the bottom of the SSC+ site.

Centralizing this in Onyx will allow the use of a single tool and reduce the number of ITSM tools used by employees. The initiative will also include the further development of an enterprise platform known as GC ITSM to address the ITSM requirements of partner departments. Key milestones include: Complete the migration of SSC services and employees working in partner-owned tools into Onyx Increase the level of ITSM integrations between SSC and its partner departments, allowing for increased information flow and visibility Upgrade SSC\\u2019s version of its ITSM tool to improve the user experience and to take advantage of new and innovative functionality OCS-2: Mercury Program The National Research Council\\u2019s (NRC) Mercury Program is committed to modernizing its operations by migrating science workloads to newer, more secure corporate and research network infrastructure. The program has committed to completing all 135 workload migrations by the 2025-26 fiscal year which will be supported by SSC. SSC will securely decommission NRC\\u2019s high-risk legacy network by 2026-27 by completing the following milestones: Addressing major security vulnerabilities in the legacy network Migrating over 130 high-value research workloads from NRC\\u2019s legacy network to the Government of Canada\\u2019s Secure Research Network Decommissioning legacy infrastructure Successfully completing annual migration plans OCS-3: Modernize Business Request to Fulfillment This initiative will design, integrate and deploy the desired end state environment for service management. This end state will simplify the delivery of SSC services to partners and clients and also improve timeliness of services. Improvements to service management will enhance operational excellence through the modernization of the front-end client management systems and back-end operational systems.

In 2024-25, SSC will continue to develop its EEM capabilities to improve the proactive diagnosis of issues and, therefore, improve responses to IT events and incidents. This will ultimately improve the performance of the GC\\u2019s IT infrastructure. Key milestones include: Perform a monitoring tool inventory throughout SSC Develop a monitoring tool roadmap Expand infrastructure discovery across end state data centres and network hubs Implement Application Performance Management Solutions (APMS) with pathfinder departments in order to support fully approved Service Authorization IECC SSC is investing in the IECC project to improve the department\\u2019s monitoring and event management capabilities by establishing a new state-of-the-art Enterprise Command Centre (ECC) in the NCR, as well as building, consolidating and/or upgrading ECC sites in Montr\\u00e9al, Borden/Barrie and Moncton. The project will generate numerous efficiencies and benefits for both SSC and its partner departments and clients, and will allow for key critical operational functions to be collocated in state-of-the-art command centres. This project will realize documented benefits through the completion of each site.

Doing so without disturbing SSC employees\\u2019 daily intranet usage is easier said than done. On that note, we apologize in advance for the back-and-forth period between the 2\\u00a0platforms. Thank you for your patience. Now that MySSC+ is up and running, and has already had more than 32,000 views, it\\u2019s time to move the valuable content from the old platform to this new, user-oriented platform. The two main objectives of this transition are to: upgrade the web platform offer more features to the users To ensure that the key information appears on m MySSC+ and is easy to find, we need to develop an information architecture (IA) that will let employees navigate more naturally. The MySSC+ beta community is key in helping the innovation team understand how users decide to navigate through a website. So, why not develop the best information structure to improve navigation and search capabilities for employees? To achieve this, we need to work closely with the content owners. We need their help to: confirm if the content is still relevant choose where it will land in the new IA ensure it follows plain language and accessibility guidelines We also have to shape the information to meet new style guidelines. This means that although we will transfer all the valuable information to MySSC+, it will look different. We will start to display information so employees can search based on the function or task that they want to complete. We also want to make sure that the user experience (UX) is the best it can be to make it easier for employees to find the information they need to do their work. Stay tuned for another blog on the UX development. How will this unfold? Step 1: review content from the existing site and connect with content owners Step 2: work with content owners to identify what will move and to where Step 3: prioritize content and schedule the transition Step 4: optimize the MySSC+ search engine guide with new content Step 5: start reviewing/rewriting/migrating content Stay tuned! A team of highly qualified and motivated individuals is working hard to make sure that information you may have had a hard time finding on My SSC is fast and easy to find on MySSC+. Without even noticing, you will be charmed by this new versatile platform. Take a look at MySSC+ today; all news, messages and events are already there! Are you a content owner? Here\\u2019s what you can expect: You should contact your communications advisor. This person will be your key contact for this initiative You will play an active role alongside the comms advisor to rework and optimize the content We are aiming to do the transition as fast as possible, and aim to have 50% of the content on the new platform by June and the rest by the fall Content that still has to be reworked will stay on My SSC until it is fully moved to MySSC+ Latest releases Release 1.4.0 - Content types Release of Structured pages and Guides as content types Responsive featured blocks (block size adjusts width depending on number of blocks) Sidebar blocks Mandatory summary fields Release 1.3.0 - Accessibility and maintenance Numerous accessibility fixes Styling updates to Topic pages Users can click outside of the menu to close it Automatically populate Topic pages with their child page information Shoshana Matheson - May 20, 2022 Great progress!
