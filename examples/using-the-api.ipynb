    "# Using the SSC Assistant API\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python notebook can be used on your local device using VS Code. It contains working code that you can execute locally after cloning or copying. It demonstrates how to use the SSC Assistant API using your given API token and a user Access token (oauth2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we use the OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow. We do not support user authentication flows for API calls at this time (although it might still be technically possible). In other words, you will have to authenticate as your app itself; a user will never have to be asked for permissions to log into the app, and there will be no redirect. In order to help us support you better, we strongly recommend not using user authentication flows for the API requests at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "First, copy the `.env.example` that is adjacent to this file into a new file, `.env`. Then, fill in the variables according to the following instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables can be broadly categorized as either SSC Assistant-related, or client application-related\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSC Assistant-Related Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API_ENDPOINT\n",
    "\n",
    "The `API_ENDPOINT` points at the SSC Assistant API server that you would like to query. You will be provided this value by our team upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:5001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API_SCOPE\n",
    "\n",
    "The `API_SCOPE` defines the permissions that your session will contain. The `applicationId` (also called the `clientId`) part is referring to the SSC Assistant's ID. You will be provided this value by our team upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "API_SCOPE=api://<applicationId>/.default\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client Application-Related Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### APP_ID\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a credential that is specific to your application. This value can be retrieved from Azure Portal, and is generally provided by an App Administrator who has the correct permissions on Azure Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### APP_SECRET\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a credential that is specific to your application. This value can be retrieved from Azure Portal, and is generally provided by an App Administrator who has the correct permissions on Azure Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TENANT_ID\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a credential that is specific to your application. This value can be retrieved from Azure Portal, and is generally provided by an App Administrator who has the correct permissions on Azure Portal."
